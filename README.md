<p id="description">This project is a simple yet powerful keylogger implemented in python. A keylogger also known as keystroke logging or keyboard capturing is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard typically in a covert manner so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. This keylogger captures keystrokes from the user's keyboard input providing a comprehensive record of all the keys pressed.</p>
